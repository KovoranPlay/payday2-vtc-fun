Various Text Changes, now with way more changes and a lot less text!

**Fixable Issues:**
- The interaction for opening the coffers is probably unchanged.
- The interaction for taking the parts out of the coffers is probably unchanged.
- Lots of non-host strings (or strings more common in multiplayer) are currently unchanged.
- Lots of "You require X item" strings are unchanged.

**Unfixable Issues:**
- The server in IT in Hoxton Breakout Day 2 says "TAKE" instead of "PICKUP".
- The chrome skull in Biker Heist Day 1 says "PICKUP" instead of "TAKE".
- This mod does not play nicely with PDTH HUD. Any text that I've removed (being revived, "You need X item", etc) will display an interaction bar but no text.
