Various Text Changes, now with way more changes and a lot less text!

**Fixable Issues:**
- The safe house interactions related to opening and taking the parts out of the coffers are unchanged.
- Non-host strings are (probably) unchanged.
- Lots of "You require X item" strings are unchanged.

**Unfixable Issues:**
- The server in IT in Hoxton Breakout Day 2 says "TAKE" instead of "PICKUP".
- The chrome skull in Biker Heist Day 1 says "PICKUP" instead of "TAKE".
- This mod does not play nicely with PDTH HUD. Any text that I've removed (being revived, "You need X item", etc) will display an interaction bar but no text. Any other HUD's that add a border to interactions might also act weirdly, but outside of being visually strange they should work fine.
- Cameras detecting bodybags will use the "suspicious activity" reason instead of a bodybag reason. This is a bug with the base game, due to Overkill not prefixing the camera bodybag string properly.
